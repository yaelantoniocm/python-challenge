# python-challenge

Bootcamp with EdX and Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey in Ciencia de Datos. Challenge 03

There are 3 folders, Images, PyBank and PyPoll, inside PyBank comes the first activity in a main.py and inside the PyPoll folder comes the same activity called main.py, both are run at the height where the " main.py" with python3 main.py

## The classes are already documented, however I will explain a little about them.

- In the PyBank activity, it is to repeat what was seen in class, it is something simple since the budget_data data is only two columns and it is to subtract the current one with the previous month, I only had problems with the average, because at the beginning the first value when it was just change = profit - previous_month_profit, I used an if conditional to fix that and that's why I put a print of changes and there I realized the error.

- For PyPoll the task was a bit more laborious, initially consider a dictionary and save the names that appeared and add 1 to the number in the dictionary, however it was taking extra steps that I didn't see necessary and that in this case They did not specify that I should do it in any case, I decided to keep it simple and since I knew that there were only 3 candidates and I knew their names, I used them, compared the names that appeared when I went through the files and increased the variable of votes for each candidate by one more if it appeared and ingf the end do prints and basic operations
